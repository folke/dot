On a remote, icy planet, the soldier known as Breq is drawing closer to
completing her quest. Once, she was the Justice of Toren - a colossal
starship with an artificial intelligence linking thousands of soldiers
in the service of the Radch, the empire that conquered the galaxy. Now,
an act of treachery has ripped it all away, leaving her with one fragile
human body, unanswered questions, and a burning desire for vengeance.
