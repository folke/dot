Set in the far future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire
where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses that owe an
allegiance to the imperial House Corrino, Dune tells the story of young
Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of House
Atreides) as he and his family accept control of the desert planet
Arrakis, the only source of the 'spice' melange, the most important and
valuable substance in the cosmos. The story explores the complex,
multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology,
and human emotion as the forces of the empire confront each other for
control of Arrakis.

Published in 1965, it won the Hugo Award in 1966 and the inaugural
Nebula Award for Best Novel. Dune is frequently cited as the world's
best-selling sf novel.
