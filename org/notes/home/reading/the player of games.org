The Culture - a humanoid/machine symbiotic society - has thrown up many
great Game Players. One of the best is Jernau Morat Gurgeh, Player of
Games, master of every board, computer and strategy. Bored with success,
Gurgeh travels to the Empire of Azad, cruel & incredibly wealthy, to try
their fabulous game, a game so complex, so like life itself, that the
winner becomes emperor. Mocked, blackmailed, almost murdered, Gurgeh
accepts the game and with it the challenge of his life, and very
possibly his death.
